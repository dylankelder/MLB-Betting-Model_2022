# MLB-Betting-Model_2022
This program collects and organizes over 6,000 MLB statistics daily. Its purpose is to efficiently gather MLB data for my sports betting models. I run this script daily and use the data for my machine learning models.

# FanGraphs-Historical-Data-by-Day
This script scrapes FanGraphs data for a given URL for each day of the 2021 season (over 180 days in total, resulting in over 5,400 rows of data). This script uses team bullpen data as its URL, but can be replaced with any FanGraphs URL or any year. Programs like this helped me gather sufficient and accurate historical data to build machine learning betting models.

# FanGraphs-Exports
This program automatically logs into FanGraphs and exports data to be used in the "MLB Betting Model_2022.py" file. Run this file before running the "MLB Betting Model_2022.py" file.
